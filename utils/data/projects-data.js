    name: "Voice Authentication System with Audio Deepfake Detection",
    description:
      "Developed a secure, browser-based voice authentication system to prevent unauthorized access, enhanced with machine learning-based audio deepfake detection. The system authenticates users against registered voice samples and classifies uploaded audio as genuine or deepfake. It integrates voice registration, live passphrase transcription (using OpenAI Whisper), speaker verification (utilizing a pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN model), and OTP delivery within a secure web application. The deepfake detection model, combining convolutional and dense neural networks, processes ten distinct audio features and achieved strong in-domain performance (AUC=0.99).",
